## General Information
This project was made as a school project in [kood/JÃµhvi](https://kood.tech/) (05.29.2022)

The project required me to create a CLI ATM System application. The project was given to me in a half finished state so I had to add the missing methods.

  **NB! Different source control platform was used hence no commit history.**

## Features
- Registration of new users
- Authentication
- Money transactions
- User accounts

## Technologies Used

[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))

## Team & My Work
This project had to be done solo.

 The methods I had to implement were: registration of new users, updating existing users data, checking the data of existing users, money transacion, removal of accounts and transfer ownership of accounts. 

## Main Learnings
- Introduction to lower level language like C
- Basics of an CLI app
- Basics of pointers
- Makefile
- *manual memory management* - Who thought that was a good idea? =)
